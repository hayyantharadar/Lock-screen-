### Dependencies
- **camera**: Front camera access for security photos
- **path_provider**: File system access for saving images
- **local_auth**: Biometric authentication (fingerprint/face)
- **audioplayers**: Sound effects for feedback
- **shared_preferences**: Secure settings storage
- **lottie**: Animation support (prepared for future enhancements)
- **flutter_native_splash**: Animated splash screen
- **flutter_launcher_icons**: Custom app icon generation

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.35.1 or higher
- Android SDK with API level 33
- Java 17 JDK
- Android device or emulator for testing

### Build Instructions
1. Clone or extract the project files
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Generate app icons and splash screen:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
   flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
   ```
5. Build release APK:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

### Permissions Required
The app requires the following Android permissions:
- `CAMERA`: For security photo capture
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: For saving captured images
- `USE_BIOMETRIC`: For fingerprint authentication
- `USE_FINGERPRINT`: Legacy fingerprint support

## Usage Guide

### Setting Up the Lock
1. Launch the app to see the main screen
2. Choose your preferred lock type using the selector at the top
3. The app uses default passwords for demonstration:
   - Number Lock: `123456`
   - Pattern Lock: L-shape pattern (dots 0,1,2,5,8)
   - Alphanumeric Lock: `secure123`

### Using Biometric Authentication
- If supported by your device, a biometric button will appear
- Tap the biometric button to authenticate with fingerprint or face
- Successful biometric authentication bypasses the lock screen

### Security Behavior
- **Correct Password**: Instant unlock with success animation
- **Wrong Password (1st-2nd attempt)**: Sound alert + "ACCESS DENIED"
- **Wrong Password (3rd+ attempt)**: Silent camera capture + temporary lockout
- **Lockout Period**: 30 seconds after multiple failed attempts

## Customization

### Changing Default Passwords
Edit the default values in `lock_type_selection_screen.dart`:
```dart
final String _defaultNumberPassword = '123456';
final List<int> _defaultPattern = [0, 1, 2, 5, 8];
final String _defaultAlphanumericPassword = 'secure123';
```

### Theme Customization
Modify colors and styles in `app_theme.dart`:
```dart
static const Color primaryColor = Color(0xFF00FFFF);
static const Color secondaryColor = Color(0xFF00FF80);
static const Color backgroundColor = Color(0xFF0A0A0A);
```

### Adding New Lock Types
1. Create a new screen in the `screens/` directory
2. Implement the lock logic following existing patterns
3. Add the new type to `LockType` enum in `lock_type_selection_screen.dart`
4. Update the selection UI and routing logic

## Security Considerations

### Photo Capture
- Photos are captured silently without user notification
- Images are saved to external storage with timestamp
- Consider implementing server upload for enhanced security

### Data Storage
- User preferences are stored using SharedPreferences
- Consider upgrading to flutter_secure_storage for sensitive data
- Biometric data is handled by the system, not stored by the app

### Lockout Mechanism
- Temporary lockout prevents brute force attacks
- Lockout duration and attempt limits are configurable
- Consider implementing progressive lockout times

## Performance Optimization

### Build Optimization
The app is configured for optimized release builds:
- Minified code and resources
- Optimized images and assets
- Reduced APK size through tree shaking

### Runtime Performance
- Efficient animation controllers with proper disposal
- Lazy loading of heavy resources
- Optimized particle system for smooth background animation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Camera Permission Denied**: Ensure camera permissions are granted
2. **Biometric Not Available**: Check device biometric settings
3. **Build Failures**: Verify Java 17 and Android SDK setup
4. **Performance Issues**: Test on physical device for accurate performance

### Debug Mode
For development and testing:
```bash
flutter run --debug
```

### Logs and Debugging
Enable verbose logging by checking console output for:
- Camera service initialization
- Biometric availability
- Security event logging
- Animation performance metrics

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Custom lock patterns and lengths
- Multiple user profiles
- Remote unlock capabilities
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Cloud backup of security events

### Technical Improvements
- Implement proper state management (Provider/Riverpod)
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Add accessibility features for disabled users
